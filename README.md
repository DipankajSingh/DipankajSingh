# Hi, I'm Dipankaj.

I build Android applications and utility tools. I focus on clean architecture, logic, and solving actual problems. If it works on my machine (Ubuntu), I ship it.

### 🛠️ What I'm Building

I am currently focused on **MuteMaster**, an Android utility that automates device muting based on location context. It handles background services and location APIs to solve real-world distractions and is currently in closed testing.

In parallel, I'm developing **ResumeRoast**, an AI-powered tool designed to give brutally honest resume feedback using Generative AI. I also maintain **notifice**, a lightweight NPM library for efficient notification handling.
